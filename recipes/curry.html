    <h3>About This Dish</h3>
    
    <p>Yep, you read that correctly… this curry is a one pan meal and it comes together in less than 30 minutes, but tastes like it’s been cooking for much longer! For this recipe I stuck with basic, pantry staple ingredients you likely already have.</p>
    
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>yellow onion</li>
        
        <li>sweet potato</li>
        
        <li>curry paste (red or green curry paste will work)</li>

        <li>coconut milk</li>

        <li>chickpeas - I used canned chickpeas for ease</li>

        <li>rice</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>Heat oil in a large skillet oer medium-high heat. 
            Add the onion to theskillet and cook, stirring 
            frequently, for about 5-6 minutes or until fragrant.
            Add curry paste to the skillet, toss and saute for 
            another minute.</li>

        <li>Add sweet potatoes, chickpeas and coconut milk to the 
            skillet and stir to combine.</li>

        <li>Allow the sauce to heat up until it is simmering and 
            let simmer for about 10-15 minutes or until sweet 
            potatoes are tender enough to be easily pierced with
            a fork. If the mixture gets too thick you can add 
            water to the pan, 1/4 cup at a time, up to 1/2 cup.
            Taste and season with salt and pepper, if needed.</li>

        <li>Serve curry over rice with cilantro and a squeeze
            of lime.
        </li>
    </ol>
